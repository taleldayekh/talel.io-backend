# Codebase

## Development

### Setup

1. **Clone repository**  

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:taleldayekh/talel.io-backend.git
   ```

2. **Set Git Hooks path**  

   This is necessary for using the hooks located in the `.githooks` directory.

   ```bash
   make set-githooks-path
   ```

### Code Style

To maintain consistency across the codebase, coding standards that conforms to the _*PEP 8*_ style guide are enforced with the help of:

- [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf) for reformatting the code.  
  
  ```bash
  make fix
  ```

- [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) for sorting and separating imports.  
  
  ```bash
  make fix
  ```

To help detect errors and reduce bugs the following static code analysis tools are used:

- [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) for checking type errors.  
  
  ```bash
  make type-check
  ```

- [Pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint) for checking programming errors.  
  
  ```bash
  make lint
  ```

### Testing

Tests are written using the [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) framework and test coverage reports are generated with [pytest-cov](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov) and uploaded to [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/).

**Run tests**

```bash
make test
```

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment

The Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines for testing, building and releasing code runs using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions) workflows. The CI pipeline runs whenever a pull request is created to merge with `develop` or `main` and the CD pipeline runs together with the CI pipeline when a pull request is created to merge with `main`.
